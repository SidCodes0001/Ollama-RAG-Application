In the game, players control a customizable character on a quest to repair the Elden Ring and become the new Elden Lord. The game is set in an open world, presented through a third-person perspective, and includes several types of weapons and magic spells. Players can traverse the six main areas using their steed Torrent and discover linear hidden dungeons and checkpoints that enable fast travel and attribute improvements. Elden Ring features online multiplayer mode for cooperative play or player-versus-player combat. The game was developed with inspirations from Dark Souls series, and contributions from George R.R. Martin on the narrative and Tsukasa Saitoh, Shoi Miyazawa, Tai Tomisawa, Yuka Kitamura, and Yoshimi Kudo for the original soundtrack. Elden Ring received critical acclaim for its open world, gameplay systems, and setting, with some criticism for technical performance. It sold over 20 million copies and a downloadable content expansion, Shadow of the Erdtree, is planned to be released in June 2024.'}"
